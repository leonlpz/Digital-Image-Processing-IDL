# Digital-Image-Processing-IDL
The objective of this repository is to cover chapters of interest in the book digital image processing from the second edition by the authors Rafael C. Gonz√°lez and Richard E. Woods. https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Rafael-C-Gonzalez/dp/0201180758

To achieve this, I use the IDL (Interactive Data Language) programming language. https://www.harrisgeospatial.com/Software-Technology/IDL 

I hope it can be usefull to anyone interested in this discipline. 

The code has a mixture of Spanish and English that I use for my own purposes but that I will gradually organize to fully English.
